Project Euler Tribute e007
* Two numbers are coprime if they have no common factors except 1.
* The totient Ï†(n) of a positive integer n greater than 1 is defined to be the number of positive integers less than n that are coprime to n.

* Compute the sum of the totients of the first 10000 prime numbers
* The solution is in the code. Don't look at it until you've written it.
